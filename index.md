title: Policies Overview

## Purpose
Policies and procedures are only as valuable as the degree to which they are followed.

This site is an attempt to organize policies and procedures in a way that they can be easily traced back to the criteria that necessitate them, thereby making the "_why?_" more accessible and hopefully getting more implicit buy-in for compliance.

## Structure guide
The layering structure of this wiki builds from criteria, through policies and responsibilities, up to procedures:

[Criteria]({% link content/criteria.md %}) – defines the criteria that prompt our policies and explains __why__ we care.

[Policies]({% link content/policies.md %}) – states __what__ policies we will hold to, to ensure all criteria are met.

[Responsibilities]({% link content/responsibilities.md %}) – states __who__ is responsible for the enforcement of specific policies, and who will be subject to given policies.

[Procedures]({% link content/procedures.md %}) – clarifies __how__ policies will be applied in practice.
