layout: procedure
# "title" is a mandatory property, "excerpt" is recommended but optional.
#
# "category" is used to group procedures on the "Procedures" overview page -- it is optional,
# but once you have more than a few procedures, you probably will want to start categorizing
# them so they are easier to find.
#
# If you want to keep this example in your repository, but not have it show up in your content,
# remove the "---" around this header and the processor will no longer recognize this as content.
category: example
title: Example Procedure
excerpt: This is an excerpt of the example procedure to showcase where it shows up.

This is custom content for the procedure that gets inserted into the page.

Note that you do not have to build your own tables of cross-references, these will be
generated by the layout template.
