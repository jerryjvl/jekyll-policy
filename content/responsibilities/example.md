# "title", "enforcer" and "owner" are mandatory properties, "excerpt" is recommended but optional.
#
# "enforcer" should be a specific employee or category of employee that will take responsibility for
# the maintenance of the responsibility and its related criteria, policies and procedures. The
# enforcer is also responsible for making sure the "owners" know about their responsibilities and
# that they execute them.
#
# "owner" can be a group, role or category of employee, which will be responsible for executing
# this responsibility.
#
# If you want to keep this example in your repository, but not have it show up in your content,
# remove the "---" around this header and the processor will no longer recognize this as content.
