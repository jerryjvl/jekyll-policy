# "criteria_type" and "title" are mandatory properties, "excerpt" is recommended but optional.
#
# For criteria_type, use one of: "company", "certification", "audit", "legal" to identify the type of criteria.
# The title and excerpt are liberally used in the automatically generated navigation for this site and increase
# the usefulness to your employees.
#
# If you want to keep this example in your repository, but not have it show up in your content,
# remove the "---" around this header and the processor will no longer recognize this as content.

This is custom content for the criteria bundle that gets inserted into the page.

Note that you do not have to build your own list of criteria, just create a directory with the same name
as this file (minus the extension), and then put each criterion on a page inside that folder.
