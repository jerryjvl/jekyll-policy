# "title" is the only mandatory property, "excerpt" is recommended but optional.
#
# The order value can be specified to ensure criteria are listed in a specific order within their
# criteria_bundle, if not specified the criteria will be ordered by title instead.
# The category will be shown within the criteria_bundle and can be used to annotate criteria that
# are related; most certifications organize criteria into logical groups.
#
# If you want to keep this example in your repository, but not have it show up in your content,
# remove the "---" around this header and the processor will no longer recognize this as content.
